# YMG
YMG (You Must Guess) is a brutal esoteric programming language which is impossible to write anything in.<br>
Due to the nature of YMG, every single character is swapped out for a randomly generated alphanumeric character, Every. Single. Time you open the program, every single char is remmaped to a randomly generated char, but some keywords, for things such as the std output "print" call is a 3 letter randomly generated alphanumeric string, also things such as "let" equivilents are, it is theoretically impossible to write a program in YMG. It is turing complete but i will not attempt to write docs for this, it is physically impossible to write any docs as the language is different every single time you open it. I have included a "example" program called test.ymg, do not try running this. This is just a theoretical program.
